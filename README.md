## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your own copy of the app running.

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1.  Go to [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account.
2.  Click **"New Project"**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "My Recipes") and a secure password.
4.  Wait for the database to set up.

### 2. Setup the Database

1.  In your Supabase Dashboard, look for the **SQL Editor** icon in the left sidebar.
2.  Click **"New Query"**.
3.  Copy and paste the following SQL code into the editor and click **"Run"**. This creates all necessary tables and security rules.

```sql
-- 1. Create Tables
create table recipes (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  name text not null,
  instructions text,
  prep_time numeric,
  cook_time numeric,
  servings numeric,
  image_url text
);

create table ingredients (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null unique
);

create table recipe_ingredients (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  recipe_id bigint references recipes(id) on delete cascade not null,
  ingredient_id bigint references ingredients(id) not null,
  quantity numeric not null
);

create table meal_plan (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  slot_id text not null, -- e.g. "Monday-Breakfast"
  recipe_id bigint references recipes(id) on delete cascade not null,
  portions numeric
);

-- 2. Enable Security (RLS)
alter table recipes enable row level security;
alter table ingredients enable row level security;
alter table recipe_ingredients enable row level security;
alter table meal_plan enable row level security;

-- 3. Add Access Policies (Allows any logged-in user to edit)
create policy "Allow authenticated users" on recipes for all using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
create policy "Allow authenticated users" on ingredients for all using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
create policy "Allow authenticated users" on recipe_ingredients for all using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
create policy "Allow authenticated users" on meal_plan for all using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### 3. Configure Authentication

To ensure email verification redirects you back to your app:

1.  Go to **Authentication** (left sidebar) -> **URL Configuration**.
2.  Set the **Site URL** to your app's URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/recipes` or `http://localhost:port`).
3.  Click **Save**.

*Note: When you sign up, check your email for a confirmation link to activate your account.*

**Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended)**
1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Go to your repository **Settings** -> **Pages**.
3.  Select the `main` branch as the source and click **Save**.
4.  Visit your new URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/recipes`).

**Option B: Local**
1.  Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.

### 5. Connect the App
